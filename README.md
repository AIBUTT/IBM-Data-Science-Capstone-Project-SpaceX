# IBM_DS_CAPSTONE_SPACEX
This is Course 10 of the 10-Courses IBM Data Science Certification.
Capstone Final Project is about studying SpaceX Launch History of Falcon 9 Rocket and Future Prediction.
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for Systematic Analysis of the Data:

        SpaceX_Data_Collection_API uses API to collect Data from SpaceX website
        
        SpaceX_Data_Wrangling is about Data Wrangling
        
        SpaceX_Data_Exploration_SQL is about getting an insight about the Data using SQL
        
        SpaceX_Data_Visualization is about using advanced visualization tools like Matplotlib, NumPy and Pandas to further explore the Data
        
        spacex_dash_app.py is about creating a Dashboard using Plotly
        
        SpaceX_Launch_Site_Location is about using Folium to pull the Launching Sites on Map and retrieve information in interactive manner
        
        Machine_Learning_Pridiction_ALGO uses Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the outcome of Falcon-9 Landing at four different Launch Sites.
        We used Logestic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Classification Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithms to make predictions.
